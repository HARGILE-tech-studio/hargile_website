/* The other offer you are NOT reading, plus the way back to the index.

   Without this a detail page is a dead end: the offers only ever linked
   downward from /services, so moving between two of them meant the browser's
   back button. That is a navigation problem first — a visitor comparing two
   offers is the most interesting visitor on the site — and an internal-linking
   problem second: the detail pages sat on a single inbound link each, from one
   hub, with nothing between siblings.

   HARG-302: down to two offers (geo, web) since /services/seo merged into
   /geo. `current` still exists for when a third offer returns — dropping it
   now to hardcode "the other one" would be the wrong economy for a two-line
   filter.

   Named by the offer, not "read more": the link text IS the crawlable signal,
   so it reuses the index's own offer titles (pages.services.index.offers.*)
   rather than restating them. One copy of that string, in one place.

   `current` is the key to leave out. Passing the wrong one shows both rows
   including the page you are on — visible immediately, which is why this takes
   a key rather than reading the route. */

/* The four offers as typographic bands.

   This replaces the 2×2 grid of square cells, which replaced the sticky spine.
   The grid gave the four offers equal weight but also equal voice: four boxes
   of the same size, each with a title sized to fit its quarter of the page.
   The name of the offer is the only thing on this page a reader is actually
   scanning for, so here it takes the full measure — one offer per band, the
   name across the container, the promise whispering in the margin.

   Nothing is fenced and nothing is filled: the bands are told apart by a single
   hairline each, and the only thing that moves under the pointer is the
   chevron. The names drift horizontally with the scroll (useScrollDrift) — the
   page's one scroll-linked gesture, and it stops the moment the reader does.

   Bands alternate side: odd names sit left with their promise pushed right,
   even names mirror. Below 768px the mirror is dropped — a right-aligned name
   on a phone reads as a mistake, not a rhythm.

   The anchor is the title and its ::after stretches over the band: one hit
   area, one focus stop, and the accessible name stays the offer. */

/* The hero's backdrop: the wave grid, and only the wave grid.

   This used to be a switcher over four variants (colour bends / cubes / wave /
   none) so the three treatments could be compared side by side. That comparison
   happened, Mihai picked the wave grid, and it was promoted to `/` at every
   width — after which the other two were reachable only through a `?backdrop=`
   debug flag no visitor ever types. They are removed rather than left in place:
   an unreachable second backdrop is what let the page carry two unrelated
   designs either side of a breakpoint in the first place, and `git show
   09ddb03:…/cube-grid.jsx` is a better archive than a dead import.

   It used to mount at once, with three.js even prefetched at module evaluation

   instances, two shader compiles and the shadow pass inside the hydration
   window: ~450 ms of desktop TBT and a Speed Index held behind the loader, which
   is what capped desktop Lighthouse at 70-75 while mobile (no canvas) sat at
   93-98. The still is the same composition, so nothing is missing before the
   first pointer move — and the live grid is driven by the pointer anyway.

   Not on a timer: a timer lands inside the trace Lighthouse measures, and would
   put the same long tasks back into TBT. Reduced motion never wakes it — the
   live grid would only render the still frame the image already shows.

/* The homepage's own quiet zone — deliberately NOT the /services ellipse.

   That one is tuned to a single answer paragraph sitting in the left column of a
   two-column hero (x -6.1…-0.1, z 0.3…2.1). This hero puts eyebrow, a large
   headline, a paragraph and a CTA row down the same side, so the region to keep
   dark is much taller: roughly the full vertical middle of the frame, against a
   visible extent of about z ±3.9. Hence rz 3.0 rather than 1.9, and a centre
   near the vertical middle rather than below it.

   **depth is the dial to move first, and it has been moved twice.** It ran at
   0.55 against the services 0.8, on the reasoning that the .backdrop mask
   (hero.module.scss) already fades the canvas out across the copy side, so a
   full-depth damp under it flattened the left half to a dead plate — the two
   doing one job between them. In practice 0.55 left ripples crossing the copy
   from the eyebrow down through the CTA row, which is the one thing the quiet
   zone exists to prevent, so it is back at the services value.

   If this now reads as a dead plate rather than a dark bed, the fix is to come
   back down (0.65–0.7), NOT to move the seeds: a seed cannot light the frame
   without throwing a ~6-unit ring through the middle on its way there. See the
   note on CALM in wave-grid.jsx.

   Module-level so the reference is stable: WaveGrid rebuilds its scene when this
   changes, and an inline literal would be a new object on every render. */

/* The phone's quiet zone — a horizontal BAND, not a copy of the wide ellipse.

   The wide frame puts copy down the left and light on the right, so its ellipse
   is off-centre and the light arrives from the side. A phone has one column:
   eyebrow, headline, paragraph, both CTAs and the rail all run down the middle
   with nothing beside them. There is no side for the light to come from — so the
   quiet zone spans the full width and is short in z, and the light arrives from
   above and below instead. That is what makes the copy read as sitting *in* the
   surface rather than on a dark rectangle laid over it.

   ⚠️ These numbers are derived from the phone framing, not from the wide one,
   and the first version of this constant got that wrong: it used rx 3.4 when the
   entire visible half-width was 2.3, so it damped the screen edge to edge and
   exported a black column.

   At HOME_RELIEF_PHONE's radius 22 the visible extent is x ±3.70, z ±8.00 (below
   REF_ASPECT the vertical FOV is pinned at 40°, so height is 2·R·tan20° = 0.728·R
   and width is that times the aspect). Hence rx 5.4 — comfortably past the frame
   edge, so the damping never shows a rim — and rz 4.6, which is 0.58 of the
   half-height and ramps out via RIM_OUT 1.35 by z ≈ 6.2, leaving the top and
   bottom fifths lit.

   rx and rz were first derived at radius 26 (x ±4.37, z ±9.46) and deliberately
   left alone when the radius came down to 22: both are ratios that still hold at
   the tighter framing, and re-deriving them would have changed the composition
   Mihai approved. If the radius moves again, check them against the formula
   above rather than assuming they still clear the frame.

   depth is 0.7 rather than the wide frame's 0.8: below 1024px .backdrop already
   drops to opacity 0.6 with no mask at all (hero.module.scss), so the same damp
   lands on an already-quieter surface. */

/* The 641-1023px band's quiet zone. A band like the phone's, not an ellipse like
   the wide frame's: the hero has already stacked into one full-width column by
   this width, so there is again no side for the light to arrive from.

   Sized from this frame's own world extents, which is the mistake
   HOME_CALM_PHONE made the first time. Below REF_ASPECT the vertical FOV is
   pinned at 40°, so visible height is 2·R·tan20° = 0.728·R and visible width is
   that times the aspect. At HOME_RELIEF_TABLET's radius 18 and 0.8:1 that is
   x ±5.24, z ±6.55 — hence rx 7.0 (past the frame edge, so the damping never
   shows a rim) and rz 3.8, which holds the same band-to-frame proportion the
   phone uses (0.58 of the half-height) and ramps out by z ≈ 5.1 via RIM_OUT,
   leaving the top and bottom fifths lit.

   depth 0.7 matches the phone rather than the wide frame's 0.8, for the reason
   the phone has it: .backdrop drops to opacity 0.6 with no mask below 1024px
   (hero.module.scss), and this band is on that side of the breakpoint. */

/* The colour ramp is deliberately NOT overridden here.

   It was, briefly — a more saturated mid, on the theory that the homepage hero
   could carry more colour than /services. Wrong call: the lit tone is
   $accent-mihai (#96b9f9, _theme.scss), the brand accent, and it is what the
   /services grid, that page's eyebrow and this page's own eyebrow and rail dots
   all already use. Pushing the homepage cubes off it made this one hero the only
   surface on the site lit in a colour nothing else uses.

   So both heroes take WaveGrid's default ramp and the grid reads as the same
   object on both pages. If the surface needs more presence, `relief` is the
   dial — the ramp keys off height, so a taller surface is a more colourful one
   without moving the hue off brand. */

/* Relief for the phone frame only — "reaches higher, and you can see the
   levels".

   Two separate things, and only doing both reads as 3D:

   - **radius** pulls the camera back, from 14 to 22. This one is not optional:
     at the default distance a phone aspect sees only world x ±2.3, about six
     pillars across the whole screen, which reads as a few flat slabs rather than
     as a grid at all. See WaveGrid's prop docs for why distance rather than a
     wider field of view.

     ⚠️ **This is a decoration dial, not a fidelity dial, and it was set wrong
     twice by treating it as one.** 26 came from the frustum maths (predicted
     eleven pillars across, delivered nine). 34 was then chosen to match the wide
     frame's fifteen, on the reasoning that both heroes should read as the same
     object. Mihai rejected that on sight: at phone size fifteen pillars is a
     busy mosaic competing with the copy, and the phone's job here is to decorate
     and suggest depth, not to reproduce the desktop grid. 22 gives about eight —
     big enough to read as objects, few enough to stay out of the way.

     So: count pillars on the exported image rather than deriving them, and judge
     the count against the phone frame, not against `home.*`.
   - **maxHeight** raises the clamp, so overlapping ripples stack into genuinely
     taller pillars instead of all flattening at the same ceiling. Amplitude is
     left alone: raising it instead makes every ripple taller, including the ones
     that should stay low, which just brightens the whole plate.
   - **view** tilts the camera further off overhead. This is the one that shows
     *sides* of pillars rather than only their tops — dead overhead, a height
     difference survives as colour alone and the frame reads flat however tall it
     is. A phone frame can afford more tilt than a wide one because the grid edge
     enters a narrow frustum much later.

     ⚠️ **But more tilt is not more depth, and past a point it is less.** With
     big pillars at radius 22 the obvious move for "make it read 3D" is to push
     `mx` toward its −1 limit. Rendered, that goes the wrong way: sides face away
     from the key light, so the extra side area that appears is *dark* area. The
     frame dims overall and the lit tops that carry the accent colour shrink.
     −0.2 with `maxHeight` left at 1.05 beat −0.9 at 1.35 outright. Depth here
     comes from the pillars being large enough to have visible edges at all, not
     from rotating further off vertical.

   Still inside WaveGrid's ±1 normalised range, which caps at ±5.4°/±9°; past it
   the frustum points out across the grid toward its boundary. */

/* Relief for the 641-1023px band. Same treatment as the phone, one step less of
   it: this frame is physically wider, so it can carry more pillars before they
   stop reading as objects.

   radius 18 puts about eleven across, sitting between the phone's eight and the
   wide frame's fifteen — the screen grows, the pillar count grows with it, and
   the pillars themselves stay roughly the size they are on a phone. `maxHeight`
   and `view` are the phone's values unchanged, because those were settled by

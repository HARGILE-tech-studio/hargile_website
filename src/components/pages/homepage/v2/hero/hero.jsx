/* The hero backdrop is the wave grid, at every width and with no branch left to
   resolve — chosen over cubes and colour bends after comparing them side by
   side, then made the only one (see hero-backdrop.jsx).

   Two things follow from there being no variant, and both are why the branching
   is gone rather than merely unused:

   - There used to be a *viewport* branch — cubes above 1024px, colour bends
     below — which meant two unrelated designs on one page: a lattice on desktop,
     a drifting gradient on a phone. The wave grid answers that split inside
     itself (a live canvas on desktop, its own exported still below 1024px), so
     the design is the same everywhere and only the frame rate changes.
   - The layout is known during render rather than after an effect, which is what
     makes the capability rail server-renderable. That mattered: the rail was
     desktop-only before, so its motion.* reveals never reached the SSR HTML.
     Now they would have, complete with inline `opacity: 0` — the same defect the
     h1 and the old glass cards were each fixed for. They are CSS keyframes
     instead. */

/* Signals when the hero's backdrop has actually painted, so the branded loader
   can dismiss on "hero ready" rather than a fixed timer.

   The live wave grid is an ssr:false dynamic import that appends a <canvas> once
   its context is up and the first shader is compiled. We watch the backdrop
   subtree for that element (MutationObserver), then wait two animation frames to
   guarantee a painted frame before flagging ready.

   **It has to watch for an <img> too.** Below 1024px the backdrop serves the
   exported still instead of a canvas, and a canvas-only query would never be
   satisfied — the hero would fall through to the hard timeout below and the
   loader would visibly outstay content that was already on screen. An image is
   not ready when it appears, though, only when it has decoded, so that branch
   waits on `complete` / the load event rather than resolving at once.

   A hard timeout keeps the whole thing honest: the loader must never outstay the
   content, even if a device fails to report either element. */

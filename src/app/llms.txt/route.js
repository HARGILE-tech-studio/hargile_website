 * HARG-302: rewritten for the GEO/SEO pivot. The site no longer sells web
 * dev, it sells visibility in AI answers and on Google.
 *
 * Honest expectations: the evidence for llms.txt is weak. SE Ranking's study
 * of 300 k domains found no correlation with AI citations, only one of the 50
 * most-cited domains publishes one, and Google has said publicly it does not
 * use it. We ship it because it costs nothing and a few smaller crawlers do
 * read it, not because it is expected to move anything.

The site is published in French and English. French is the default and is
served at the root: ${page("/")} is the French home page. English lives under
/en. Each page exists in both languages and the two are cross-linked with
hreflang; neither is a translation proxy of the other.

The full copy of every page is present in the first HTML response: no
JavaScript execution is required to read this site.

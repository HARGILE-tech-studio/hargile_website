// Render a hero wave grid to a still image.
//
// The grid is a single frame that never changes, so shipping three.js (~150 kB
// gzipped, plus parsing it, building 2304 instances, compiling two shader
// programs and running a shadow pass) to draw it once is a bad trade against
// ~20 kB of AVIF. This script is how the image gets made: it drives the real
// component in a real browser — the only way to run WebGL — and writes the
// canvas out as AVIF + WebP.
//
// Two pages use the grid and each needs its own image: they have different quiet
// zones and different copy layouts, so one export cannot serve both. --page
// picks which, and each writes under its own name so they can't overwrite each
// other.
//
// Usage:
//   npm run dev                                       # in another terminal
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs                 # /services, curated
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs 7 32            # /services, variants 7 and 32
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs --page=contact 7   # contact form backdrop
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs --page=home     # homepage hero, wide
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs --page=home 7   # homepage, variant 7
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs --page=phone    # homepage hero, phone frame
//   node scripts/export-wave-grid.mjs --page=tablet   # homepage hero, 641-1023px band
//
// Output: public/images/wave-grid/{curated,wave-7,home,home-wave-7,home-phone,
//         home-tablet,…}.{avif,webp}
// For the poster hero, point the `composition` prop on WaveGridBackdrop at the
// base name you keep — `wave-70` derives its own -phone and -tablet frames, so
// one name ships all three (/services takes DEFAULT_COMPOSITION, /faq passes
// its own). For the homepage, HOME_IMAGE / PHONE_IMAGE / TABLET_IMAGE in
// hero-backdrop.jsx.
//
// The `services*` targets write page-neutral names (`wave-70`, not
// `wave-70-faq`) because a composition belongs to a QUIET ZONE, not to a page,
// and /services and /faq share theirs. That is why exporting a /faq image
// through --page=services is correct rather than a shortcut.
//
// `home`, `phone` and `tablet` are the SAME hero at three aspects, and all three
// are shipped — none is a fallback for another. Re-export ALL THREE when the
// composition changes.
//
// Neither target uses a dedicated export component. That is deliberate: the
// exported image has to be the composition the live canvas draws, and a second
// mounting of WaveGrid is exactly how the two would drift apart. The homepage
// target's route renders the real homepage for the same reason.
//
// Requires agent-browser (npm i -g agent-browser) — a headless browser is
// unavoidable for WebGL, and this keeps a ~300 MB Puppeteer download out of the
// project's dependencies for a script that runs a handful of times a year.

   keeps roughly its middle 29% and throws the rest away. Composing at the served
   aspect is the only way the phone gets a frame that was laid out for it.

   layout there has already stacked into one full-width column, so the copy sits
   half over dark and half over lit.

   The phone frame cannot cover it either, and that was measured rather than
   assumed: at 0.8:1 `cover` keeps only the middle ~40% of the 0.46:1 phone
   render, and that middle is exactly its quiet band — all the light lives in the
   top and bottom thirds and is cropped away. It renders as a dead plate.

   0.8:1 is the geometric mean of the band's measured extremes: the hero
   backdrop runs 0.695 at 820x1180 and 0.938 at 1000x700, so this splits the
